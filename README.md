## 🖥️ CAD Platform 

Electron-based platform that allows organizations to create, share and collaborate on a CAD or large file based project. Similar to a GitHub type application, this platform allows you to roll-back to previous versions of the project and allows one organization to have multiple projects running at the same time. It provides a seamless user experience by automatically fetching and presenting existing repositories on launch. By using AWS S3 cloud-based file hosting, users can seamlessly upload and download large files with ease.
